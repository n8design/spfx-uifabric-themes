# SPFx-uifabric-themes - Toolkit

This toolkit improves your development workflow. It enables you to webparts create enhanced web part always matching the theme currently applied on the page.

**Current Version:** 0.8.0 - Teal;

# Installation
Create a new SharePoint Framework Project and add this package to your project.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @n8d/htwoo-core 
```

After this installation this package should be listed as a dev dependency in your SPFX Project.

# Enhanced theme slot selection

You can use it the same way like before but the variable reference will change to.

```scss
@import './node_modules/@n8d/htwoo-core/legacy/ouif.theme';
```

This new SASS file will support more that 100 different themes slots such as backgroundColor, textColor.

The variables have been renamed to follow this pattern now:

```scss
.container {
  background-color: $ouif-primaryBackground; // Adds "[theme:primaryBackground, default:#ffffff]";
}
```

# Use TypeDefinitions for `window.__themeState__` object

In your web part code add the following line to your webpart or extension project.

```typescript
import {Theme} from '@htwoo-core/legacy';
```

After that you should see the following extensions on the window object.
